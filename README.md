Apollo Governance Framework

A Human–AI Interaction Risk Monitoring Framework
⸻
# # Overview
Apollo is a governance-oriented framework designed to make human–AI interaction risks observable at a conceptual level.
The project focuses on:
 • Governance positioning
 • Design principles
 • Usage and responsibility boundaries
rather than technical implementation or system execution.
Apollo is intended to support human awareness and governance judgment, not to replace or automate them.
⸻
## ⚖️ Legal and Functional Boundaries
This framework is non-decisional, non-adjudicative, and non-automated.
It does not:
 • make judgments,
 • perform enforcement actions, or
 • issue operational determinations.
Apollo functions solely as a governance-assistive observational model, helping humans recognize when responsibility, oversight, or intervention may need to be reclaimed.

when control should not be delegated.
